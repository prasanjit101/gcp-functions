### What can this repository do? ###

* Get you started quickly with `Google Cloud Functions`
* Has provision for a basic middleware (like auth and cors)
* Uses `@google-cloud/functions-framework` for local development
* Includes deployment script `deploy-to-cloud.sh`

### How to setup on local? ###

* On your terminal, run this command: `npm install`
* Then run this command: `npm run dev`

* Moment you commit your code to `master` branch of your repository, build pipeline will start and the Google cloud function will be deployed automatically.
